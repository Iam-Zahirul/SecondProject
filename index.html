            <p class="Par">As a leader, have you found yourself comparing your mission and vision to what is happening
                in your organization? When you look honestly, do you see a gap between what you say your organization is
                about and what is actually taking place? When faced with a difficult decision or hiring choice, do you
                ever consider the mission and vision of the organization? Or do you just find the person that fits the
                job description instead of finding the person who best fits the mission and vision?</p>
